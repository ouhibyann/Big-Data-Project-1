# Big-Data-Project-1
School's project with 3 classmates.
The goal is to collect, and gather scientists' name who worked on a shared topic.
After data scrapping, a graph of collaborations will be calculated and drew.

I added some .csv file of communities after some computing done, as a result anybody with a graph vizualisation tool - I used Gephi for this project - can watch these.
I also added some .SVG so you can have a look of the communities'Graphs if you don't have any vizualisation tool.
