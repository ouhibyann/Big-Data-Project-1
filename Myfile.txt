  abstract =	"{"}There is considerable interest in identifying
		 national contributions to global warming as a way of
		 allocating historical responsibility for observed
		 climate change. ... present a new estimate of national
		 contributions to observed c.w., inc. CO2 emissions from
		 fossil fuels \& land-use change, ... also that there
		 are vast disparities in both total and per-capita
		 climate contributions among countries, and that across
		 most developed countries, per-capita contributions are
		 not currently consistent with attempts to restrict
		 global temperature change to less than 2C above
		 pre-industrial temperatures.{"} --
